# Kiln
A modern build system for C/C++.

## Overview
If you're familiar with Rust's Cargo or Python's Poetry, you'll feel right at home with Kiln. This build system is designed to simplify and streamline the development process for C and C++ projects, making it accessible and efficient for both new and experienced developers.

### Key Features
- **Project Initialization**: Create a new project with a single command:
```bash
kiln new proj-name
```
- **Automated Build Process**: Compile your project effortlessly with:
```bash
kiln build
```
- No need to manually link every file.
- Common libraries like `math` and `pthreads` are automatically detected and linked.

- **Run Your Project**: Execute your project seamlessly:
```bash
kiln run
```

- **Header File Management**: Automatically generate or update header files to reflect your codebase:
```bash
kiln gen-headers
```

### Why Choose Kiln?
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the traditionally complex C/C++ build process.
- **Modern Approach**: Inspired by modern tooling systems like Cargo and Poetry.
- **Productivity Boost**: Automates repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on writing code.
- **Dependency Management**: Intelligent detection and inclusion of required libraries.

## Installation
### Requirements
- **C/C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have GCC, Clang, or any compatible compiler installed.
- **CMake** (Optional): Recommended for projects that require advanced build configurations.
- **Python** (Optional): Required if Kiln uses Python scripts for some internal operations.

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kiln.git
```
2. Build and install:
```bash
cd kiln
make install
```
3. Verify installation:
```bash
kiln --version
```

## Quick Start
### Creating a New Project
To create a new project directory and set up the build environment:
```bash
kiln new my_project
```
This will create a folder `my_project` with the following structure:
```
my_project/
├── src/
│   ├── main.c
│   └── utils.c
├── include/
│   └── utils.h
├── Kiln.toml
```

### Building Your Project
From the root of your project directory, run:
```bash
kiln build
```
Kiln will:
- Detect all source files in `src/`.
- Link necessary libraries.
- Output the compiled binary to the `build/` directory.

### Running Your Project
To compile and execute your project:
```bash
kiln run
```

### Valgrind Integration
Execute your project with valgrind and get info about memory corruption issues. 
```bash
kiln run --valgrind
```

### Generating Header Files
Automatically create/update your header files
```bash
kiln gen-headers
```

## Roadmap
- **Advanced Dependency Management**: Support for third-party library integration (e.g., Boost, OpenSSL).
- **Cross-Platform Builds**: Native support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Continuous Integration**: Pre-configured CI pipelines for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD.
- **Performance Optimization**: Faster build times for large projects.
